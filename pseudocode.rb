write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

    a method that returns the sum of two integers
    a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
    a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

== Problem 1 ==
Given two integers
add them together
return the result

# Given two integers called first_number and second_number

SET sum = first_number + second_number
RETURN sum
